# AI Value Case & ROI Modeler

### "From AI Features to Measurable Business Impact"

The **AI Value Case & ROI Modeler** is a premium, interactive web-only demo designed for executives (CFOs, CTOs, and Business Sponsors). It demonstrates how AI initiatives translate from technical features into strategic business outcomes, measurable KPIs, and annualized ROI.

This is a "smoke-and-mirrors" demo meant for boardroom discussions, where all data is mock, deterministic, and simulated to feel real, defensible, and boardroom-ready.
